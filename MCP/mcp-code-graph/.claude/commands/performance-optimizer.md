# Performance Optimization Analysis
Optimize performance for: $ARGUMENTS

This command provides comprehensive performance optimization by:
1. Identifying performance-critical code paths
2. Analyzing resource usage patterns
3. Finding bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
4. Mapping performance-related dependencies
5. Generating optimization recommendations

Follow these steps:
1. Use nodes-semantic-search to find performance-critical components related to the target
2. Get implementation details with get-code for analysis
3. Analyze performance impact with get-usage-dependency-links
4. Find direct connections to understand data flow with find-direct-connections
5. Search for performance documentation with docs-semantic-search
6. Generate comprehensive optimization report with specific recommendations

This command is ideal for: performance audits, optimization planning, and scalability improvements.

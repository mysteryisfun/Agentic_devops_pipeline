# Deep Graph MCP Server by [CodeGPT](https://codegpt.co/)
A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server) server that enables seamless interaction with Code Graphs.

## How this works

This MCP allows you to interact with knowledge graphs available in your CodeGPT account or with public graphs from [DeepGraph](https://deepgraph.co).

To create a graph from any GitHub repository, simply change the URL from `github.com` to `deepgraph.co`. For example:
- GitHub repo: `https://github.com/username/repo`
- DeepGraph URL: `https://deepgraph.co/username/repo`

You'll be able to use these advanced graph-based queries across different MCP Hosts such as ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, CodeGPT Extension, GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others.

## Available Tools

- `list-graphs`: Lists available repository graphs with basic information.

- `get-code`: Retrieves the complete source code for a specific functionality from the graph.

- `find-direct-connections`: Explores the direct relationships of a functionality within the code graph.

- `nodes-semantic-search`: Semantically searches for code functionalities using natural language.

- `docs-semantic-search`: Semantically searches repository documentation.

- `get-usage-dependency-links`: Analyzes and lists functionalities affected by changes to a code entity.

- `folder-tree-structure`: Retrieves the tree structure of a folder in the repository.

## For Public Code Graphs (No Account Required)
You can interact with public graphs from [DeepGraph](https://deepgraph.co):

1. Find any public repository on [deepgraph.co](https://deepgraph.co)
2. Use the repository reference (e.g., `username/repository-name`)

## Installation using npx
Add the following configuration to your MCP client (CodeGPT Extension, Cursor, Copilot, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, etc.):

```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
      "Deep Graph MCP": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y" , "mcp-code-graph@latest", 
         "username/repository-name",  // DeepGraph repository URL
         "username2/repository-name2" // Add more repositories if needed
        ]
      }
   }
}
```

### For Private Graphs (CodeGPT Account Required)
Before using the CodeGPT MCP Server with private graphs, ensure you have:

1. A CodeGPT account (sign up at [app.codegpt.co](https://app.codegpt.co))
2. Uploaded a repository to [Code Graph](https://help.codegpt.co/en/articles/9912447-code-graphs)
3. Get your API Key from [CodeGPT API Keys page](https://app.codegpt.co/user/api-keys) (required).
4. Get your Organization ID (optional) and Graph ID (optional).

### Installation with npx
Add the following configuration to your MCP client (CodeGPT Extension, Cursor, Copilot, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, etc.):

```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
      "Deep Graph MCP": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y" , "mcp-code-graph@latest", 
         "CODEGPT_API_KEY",
         "CODEGPT_ORG_ID",
         "CODEGPT_GRAPH_ID"
        ]
      }
   }
}
```

# CLI Providers

## Adding to Gemini CLI

Add the JSON configuration to your settings.json file:

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22f601dd-0564-46ac-8973-161de3017e34" controls autoplay></video>

Gemini CLI uses settings.json files for persistent configuration. There are two locations for these files:

- User settings file:
Location: ~/.gemini/settings.json (where ~ is your home directory).
Scope: Applies to all Gemini CLI sessions for the current user.

- Project settings file:
Location: .gemini/settings.json within your project's root directory.
Scope: Applies only when running Gemini CLI from that specific project. Project settings override user settings.

## Adding to Claude Code

Follow these steps to integrate Deep Graph MCP Server with Claude Code.

## Quick Setup

### For Private Graphs

```bash
claude mcp add "Deep Graph MCP" npx -- -y mcp-code-graph@latest CODEGPT_API_KEY CODEGPT_ORG_ID CODEGPT_GRAPH_ID
```

### For Public Graphs
```bash
claude mcp add "Deep Graph MCP" npx -- -y mcp-code-graph@latest username/repository-name
```

**For team sharing**, add the `-s project` flag:

```bash
claude mcp add -s project "Deep Graph MCP" npx -- -y mcp-code-graph@latest CODEGPT_API_KEY CODEGPT_ORG_ID CODEGPT_GRAPH_ID
# or for public graphs
claude mcp add -s project "Deep Graph MCP" npx -- -y mcp-code-graph@latest username/repository-name username2/repository-name
```

## Verification

```bash
# Verify installation
claude mcp list

# Get server details
claude mcp get "Deep Graph MCP"
```

## Advanced Workflows with Claude Code Custom Commands

Claude Code supports custom slash commands that combine multiple MCP Code Graph tools for comprehensive analysis workflows.

### Setup

**Copy the commands directory** from this repository to your project root:
```bash
cp -r .claude/ /path/to/your/project/
```

Commit to your project's git:
```bash
git add .claude/commands/
git commit -m "Add custom Claude Code commands for Deep Graph MCP"
```

## Available Commands
Repository-wide analysis commands (no parameters needed):

```bash
/project:analyze-architecture          # Complete architectural overview
/project:security-audit               # Comprehensive security analysis

/project:technical-debt-analyzer      # Technical debt assessment
/project:api-ecosystem-analyzer       # Complete API ecosystem analysis
/project:repository-onboarding        # Full repository onboarding guide
```

Component-specific commands (require parameters):
```bash
/project:migration-planner [component/technology]     # Smart migration planning
/project:performance-optimizer [component/function]   # Performance optimization

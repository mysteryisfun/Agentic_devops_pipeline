# üöÄ Hackademia MVP Masterplan
*AI-Powered Self-Healing CI/CD Pipeline - 18 Hour Hackathon Build*

## üéØ Project Overview

**Hackademia** is an intelligent, automated CI/CD pipeline that eliminates manual bottlenecks by leveraging Multi-Agentic AI and custom fine-tuned models to streamline code quality assurance in GitHub repositories. The system automatically builds, analyzes, fixes, and tests code changes in pull requests without human intervention.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Eliminates labor-intensive manual processes** (hand-written unit tests, manual code reviews)
- **Multi-agent AI collaboration** for comprehensive code analysis
- **Self-healing code** with high-confidence automated fixes
- **Intelligent test generation** with edge-case handling
- **Zero human intervention** in the CI/CD quality assurance loop

## üë• Target Audience

**Primary**: Agile Development teams in fast-paced environments requiring rapid release cycles
**Secondary**: Open Source Projects with diverse contributors needing consistent quality checks
**Tertiary**: Enterprise DevOps teams managing large, complex codebases seeking compliance and early bug detection

### 2. **Build & Compile Agent**
- Traditional automation compiles code
- Extracts metadata and dependencies
- Prepares codebase context for AI analysis
- Validates basic compilation success

### 3. **Multi-Agentic AI Analysis System**
Four specialized AI agents work collaboratively:

#### **Build Agent**
- Handles compilation and metadata extraction
- Manages build artifacts and dependencies
- Provides build context to other agents

#### **Analyze Agent** 
- Parses code using gemini ai
- Identifies errors, bugs, security issues, and quality problems
- Uses MCP graph queries for codebase context
- Performs automated searches across codebases

#### **Fix Agent**
- Applies high-confidence fixes autonomously using the gemini
- Generates and commits changes to PR branch
- Focuses on security vulnerabilities and critical bugs
- Maintains code style and functional integrity

#### **Test Agent**
- Custom fine-tuned model (Qwen with QLoRA optimization)
- Creates comprehensive unit tests with pytest
- Automated execution with all possible input parameters
- Handles edge-case scenarios for consistency

### 4. **Automated Search and Fix**
- Agents perform automated searches using MCP graph queries
- Identify issues across entire codebase context
- Generate and apply fixes autonomously
- Cross-reference solutions with repository patterns

### 5. **Self-Healing Pipeline**
- High-confidence automated fixes applied directly
- Commits changes back to PR branch
- Validation through comprehensive testing
- Rollback mechanism for failed fixes

### 6. **AI Testing with Custom Model**
- Fine-tuned model specifically trained for unit test generation
- QLoRA optimization for efficient performance
- Realistic test scenarios with comprehensive coverage
- Automated test execution and validation
